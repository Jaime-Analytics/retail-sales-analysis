# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis — SQL Portfolio Project

![Retail Sales Dashboard](Retail Sales Performance Dashboard.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales performance using SQL.  
It demonstrates core analytical skills used in Business Intelligence and Data Analysis roles, including:

- Revenue analysis  
- Trend identification  
- Customer segmentation  
- Product and category performance  
- Regional performance  
- Window functions (ranking + running totals)  

The goal is to extract meaningful insights from a simple retail dataset and present clean, reusable SQL queries that reflect real business questions.

## 🧾 Dataset Description

`sales.csv` contains fictional retail transaction data with the following fields:

| Column       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| OrderID      | Unique order identifier |
| OrderDate    | Date of purchase |
| CustomerID   | Unique customer identifier |
| Region       | Geographic region of the sale |
| Product      | Product name |
| Category     | Product category |
| Quantity     | Units sold |
| UnitPrice    | Price per unit |

This dataset is intentionally simple to highlight SQL logic rather than data engineering.

## 📊 Key Insights (Example Findings)

These insights depend on the dataset, but typical patterns include:

- Electronics often drive the highest revenue  
- Certain regions consistently outperform others  
- A small number of customers contribute a large share of revenue  
- Monthly revenue trends reveal seasonality or growth patterns  
- Product mix analysis highlights opportunities for promotions or bundling
